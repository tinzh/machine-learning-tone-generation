    "### Sigmoid neurons simulating perceptrons, part I\n",
    "Given that $z=w\\cdot x+b$, only $\\mbox{sgn}(z)$ affects the output of the perceptron. If $w$ and $b$ are multiplied by $c>0$, then $z=(cw)\\cdot x+ (cb)=c(w\\cdot x+b$). Since the multiplication of a number by a positive constant does not change the $ \\mbox{sgn}()$ of the number, the multiplication by $c$ will not affect the output of the perceptron.\n",
    "### Sigmoid neurons simulating perceptrons, part II \n",
    "As established in part I, multiplication of $w$ and $b$ by a constant $c>0$ will cause $z$ to be multiplied by the constant $c$. So, as $c\\to\\infty$, $|z|\\to\\infty$, and $\\lim\\limits_{z\\to-\\infty}\\sigma(z)=0$ and $\\lim\\limits_{z\\to\\infty}\\sigma(z)=1$. Since the output is either 0 or 1, this behavior models a perceptron. However, if $w\\cdot x+b = z = 0$, then $\\lim\\limits_{c\\to\\infty}cz=0$, and $\\sigma(z=0)=0.5$, which is not possible with a perceptron.\n",

    "Assertion: The choice of $\\Delta v$ which minimizes $\\nabla C \\cdot \\Delta v  \\approx \\Delta C$ is $\\Delta v = -\\eta \\nabla C$ (where $\\eta = \\epsilon / \\|\\nabla C\\|$ is determined by the size constraint $\\|\\Delta v\\| = \\epsilon$, for some small fixed $\\epsilon>0$).\n",

    "According to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, $|\\nabla C \\cdot \\Delta v| \\leq \\|\\nabla C \\|\\\n",
    "\\|\\Delta v\\|$. Since there is a constraint $\\|\\Delta v\\|=\\epsilon$, $|\\nabla C \\cdot \\Delta v| \\leq \\epsilon\\|\\nabla C \\|$. Since $\\nabla C$ and $\\epsilon$ are constant, $\\epsilon\\|\\nabla C \\|$ is also constant. Also, since the absolute value is used in the inequality, the minimum for $\\nabla C \\cdot \\Delta v$ will be negative, leading to $\\nabla C\\cdot\\Delta v \\geq -\\epsilon\\|\\nabla C\\|$. Therefore, $\\mbox{min}(\\nabla C\\cdot\\Delta v) = \\epsilon\\|\\nabla C\\|$. $\\Delta v = -\\eta\\nabla C$ satisfies this equation, and is thus the minimum of $\\nabla C \\cdot\\Delta v$. \n",

    "In this case, $C$ is one-half of the squared residual between the output of a function and the expected value of the function (for confimation, see equation 6). Minimizing C leads to a smaller residual, optimizing the the function to output the desired value with the given input. The geometric interpretation is similar, with a \"ball\" ($C$) going down towards the lowest point of a hill where error is minimized.\n",
    "### Naming one advantage and one disadvantage of minibatch size of 1 (online learning) compared to a size of 20 in stochastic gradient descent\n",
    "Advantage: Less storage, i.e. no need to store $\\nabla C$ during a minibatch  \n",

    "In $-[a \\ln y + (1-a) \\ln (1-y)]$, if $y$ (the expected value for the neuron) is $0$ or $1$, there is a $\\ln 0$, which is undefined. Since $a$ is never exactly $0$ or $1$, in $-[y \\ln a  + (1-y) \\ln (1-a)]$, there will never be $\\ln 0$.\n",

    "### Showing that sigmoid output activations won't always sum to $1$\n",
    "Consider a network with an output layer of one neuron. Since the output is solely within the range of the sigmoid function $(0,1)$, the output activation will never sum to $1$. In fact, even with a network with a multi-neuron output layer, having the sum of the activations equal $1$ is impossible due to the continuity of the sigmoid function.\n",

    "If $\\mu>1$, the velocity would grow exponentially, especially towards the end of learning when the gradient descent is small. If $\\mu<0$, gradient descent would oscillate between negative and positive and defeat the purpose of building momentum, as the momentum would change constantly.\n",
